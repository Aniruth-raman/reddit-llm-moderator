# GitHub Workflow Setup

This document explains how to set up and use the minimal GitHub workflow for Reddit moderation.

## Overview

The minimal workflow provides:
- **On-demand execution**: Manual trigger via GitHub Actions UI
- **Secret-based configuration**: Config and rules passed securely via GitHub secrets  
- **Flexible execution modes**: Dry-run and debug options
- **Minimal footprint**: 10-minute timeout, efficient resource usage using uv
- **UV dependency management**: Fast and efficient Python environment setup

## Required GitHub Secrets

You need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

### 1. CONFIG

This should contain your complete configuration as a YAML string:

```yaml
reddit:
  client_id: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
  client_secret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" 
  username: "YOUR_USERNAME"
  password: "YOUR_PASSWORD"
  user_agent: "RedditModerator/1.0 by YourUsername"
  subreddit: "YourSubreddit"

approve_threshold: 80
remove_threshold: 70

llm_provider:
  provider: "gemini"
  api_key: "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
  model: "gemini-1.5-pro"
```

### 2. RULES

This should contain your subreddit rules as a YAML string:

```yaml
rules:
  - number: 1
    title: "No spam or self-promotion"
    explanation: "Posts should not be primarily for self-promotion or spamming links."
    response: "Your submission has been removed for violating Rule 1: No spam or self-promotion."
    notification_method: "public"
  
  - number: 2
    title: "Be civil and respectful"
    explanation: "Treat others with respect. Personal attacks, hate speech, and harassment are not tolerated."
    response: "Your submission has been removed for violating Rule 2: Be civil and respectful."
    notification_method: "modmail"
```

## Setting Up Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add both `CONFIG` and `RULES` secrets

## Running the Workflow

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Select "Reddit Moderation Pipeline" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Configure the options:
   - **dry_run**: Set to `true` to see what would happen without taking action
   - **debug**: Set to `true` for detailed logging

## Usage Examples

### Safe Testing Mode
```
dry_run: true
debug: true
```
This mode shows what would happen without taking any actions and provides detailed logging.

### Production Mode
```
dry_run: false
debug: false
```
This mode processes the modqueue and takes moderation actions.

## Local Testing

You can test the functionality locally with config files:

```bash
# Test in dry-run mode
python main.py --dry-run --debug

# Test normal operation  
python main.py --debug
```

## Workflow Features

- **Minimal footprint**: Uses uv for fast dependency management
- **10-minute timeout**: Ensures quick execution
- **Manual trigger only**: Runs only when you need it
- **Secret-based configuration**: No sensitive data in repository
- **Flexible options**: Control dry-run and debug logging

## Security Notes

- All sensitive configuration is stored in GitHub Secrets
- The workflow never exposes secret values in logs
- Secrets are only available during workflow execution
- The workflow has a timeout to prevent runaway processes

## Troubleshooting

If the workflow fails:

1. Check that both secrets are properly set in GitHub
2. Verify the YAML format of your secrets is valid
3. Review the workflow logs for specific error messages
4. Test locally first with config files in the repository root
