# GitHub Workflow Setup

This document explains how to set up and use the minimal GitHub workflow for Reddit moderation.

## Required GitHub Secrets

You need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

### 1. REDDIT_CONFIG_YAML

This should contain your complete configuration as a YAML string:

```yaml
reddit:
  client_id: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
  client_secret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" 
  username: "YOUR_USERNAME"
  password: "YOUR_PASSWORD"
  user_agent: "RedditModerator/1.0 by YourUsername"
  subreddit: "YourSubreddit"

approve_threshold: 80
remove_threshold: 70

llm_provider:
  provider: "gemini"
  api_key: "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
  model: "gemini-1.5-pro"
```

### 2. REDDIT_RULES_YAML

This should contain your subreddit rules as a YAML string:

```yaml
rules:
  - number: 1
    title: "No spam or self-promotion"
    explanation: "Posts should not be primarily for self-promotion or spamming links."
    response: "Your submission has been removed for violating Rule 1: No spam or self-promotion."
    notification_method: "public"
  
  - number: 2
    title: "Be civil and respectful"
    explanation: "Treat others with respect. Personal attacks, hate speech, and harassment are not tolerated."
    response: "Your submission has been removed for violating Rule 2: Be civil and respectful."
    notification_method: "modmail"
```

## Setting Up Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add both `REDDIT_CONFIG_YAML` and `REDDIT_RULES_YAML` secrets

## Running the Workflow

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Select "Reddit Moderation Pipeline" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Configure the options:
   - **dry_run**: Set to `true` to see what would happen without taking action
   - **disable_remove**: Set to `true` to comment out line 139 (disable remove actions)
   - **debug**: Set to `true` for detailed logging

## Workflow Features

- **Minimal footprint**: Uses only necessary dependencies
- **10-minute timeout**: Ensures quick execution
- **Manual trigger only**: Runs only when you need it
- **Secret-based configuration**: No sensitive data in repository
- **Flexible options**: Control dry-run, remove actions, and logging

## Security Notes

- All sensitive configuration is stored in GitHub Secrets
- The workflow never exposes secret values in logs
- Secrets are only available during workflow execution
- The workflow has a timeout to prevent runaway processes
