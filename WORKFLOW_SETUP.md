# GitHub Workflow Setup

This document explains how to set up and use the minimal GitHub workflow for Reddit moderation.

## Overview

The minimal workflow provides:
- **On-demand execution**: Manual trigger via GitHub Actions UI
- **Secret-based configuration**: Config and rules passed securely via GitHub secrets  
- **Flexible execution modes**: Dry-run, disable-remove, and debug options
- **Minimal footprint**: 10-minute timeout, efficient resource usage
- **Line 139 control**: Option to comment out remove actions at runtime

## Required GitHub Secrets

You need to set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

### 1. REDDIT_CONFIG_YAML

This should contain your complete configuration as a YAML string:

```yaml
reddit:
  client_id: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
  client_secret: "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" 
  username: "YOUR_USERNAME"
  password: "YOUR_PASSWORD"
  user_agent: "RedditModerator/1.0 by YourUsername"
  subreddit: "YourSubreddit"

approve_threshold: 80
remove_threshold: 70

llm_provider:
  provider: "gemini"
  api_key: "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
  model: "gemini-1.5-pro"
```

### 2. REDDIT_RULES_YAML

This should contain your subreddit rules as a YAML string:

```yaml
rules:
  - number: 1
    title: "No spam or self-promotion"
    explanation: "Posts should not be primarily for self-promotion or spamming links."
    response: "Your submission has been removed for violating Rule 1: No spam or self-promotion."
    notification_method: "public"
  
  - number: 2
    title: "Be civil and respectful"
    explanation: "Treat others with respect. Personal attacks, hate speech, and harassment are not tolerated."
    response: "Your submission has been removed for violating Rule 2: Be civil and respectful."
    notification_method: "modmail"
```

## Setting Up Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
4. Click "New repository secret"
5. Add both `REDDIT_CONFIG_YAML` and `REDDIT_RULES_YAML` secrets

## Running the Workflow

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Select "Reddit Moderation Pipeline" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Configure the options:
   - **dry_run**: Set to `true` to see what would happen without taking action
   - **disable_remove**: Set to `true` to comment out line 139 (disable remove actions)
   - **debug**: Set to `true` for detailed logging

## Usage Examples

### Safe Testing Mode
```
dry_run: true
disable_remove: true  
debug: true
```
This mode shows what would happen without taking any actions and provides detailed logging.

### Production Mode with Remove Disabled
```
dry_run: false
disable_remove: true
debug: false
```
This mode processes the modqueue but doesn't remove items (line 139 commented out).

### Full Production Mode
```
dry_run: false
disable_remove: false
debug: false
```
This mode processes the modqueue with all actions enabled.

## Local Testing

You can also test the functionality locally using environment variables:

```bash
export REDDIT_CONFIG_YAML="$(cat config.yaml)"
export REDDIT_RULES_YAML="$(cat rules.yaml)"

# Test with disable-remove flag
python main.py --dry-run --disable-remove --debug

# Test normal operation  
python main.py --dry-run --debug
```

## Workflow Features

- **Minimal footprint**: Uses only necessary dependencies
- **10-minute timeout**: Ensures quick execution
- **Manual trigger only**: Runs only when you need it
- **Secret-based configuration**: No sensitive data in repository
- **Flexible options**: Control dry-run, remove actions, and logging
- **Line 139 control**: Option to disable remove_item() calls at runtime

## Security Notes

- All sensitive configuration is stored in GitHub Secrets
- The workflow never exposes secret values in logs
- Secrets are only available during workflow execution
- The workflow has a timeout to prevent runaway processes

## Troubleshooting

If the workflow fails:

1. Check that both secrets are properly set in GitHub
2. Verify the YAML format of your secrets is valid
3. Review the workflow logs for specific error messages
4. Test locally first using environment variables

## What Line 139 Does

Line 139 in the original `main.py` contains:
```python
remove_item(item, f"Rule {rule_num}: {reason}")
```

When `--disable-remove` is used, this line is effectively commented out, meaning:
- The application will identify rule violations
- It will log what it would remove
- But it won't actually remove any content
- This provides a safe way to test moderation logic
